# What's FAPI (wannabe)?

FAPI (or Fapi) stands for Fake API.
It's an open source, free to contribute to API containing a lot of data usually
used by applications.

It will help the developer (especially front-end developer) to build the different basic elements
of applications with basic datum (yes datum, get over it).

# Guidelines :
- Use of Python typing
- TDD? Test for any function? (How to test an API dammit!)
